Greetings,

You had acquired product A 10 weeks ago and 85 people from your organization have leveraged it last week.

Apple (ID# 1) has utilized 85% of its 100 available licenses. This utilization rate is more than the industry average.

We have seen a surge based on the weekly active user base number. Would you like to obtain more licenses?
We have seen a decline based on the weekly active user base number. Would you like to schedule an interview to improve the product usage?

Product B also seems to be good fit for Apple. Would you like to schedule a call to know more about it?

Regards,
Your vendor.
